## This file contains two functions. The first (makeCacheMatrix) creates a matrix object that calculates its inverse
## and stores the result in the cache.
## The second one (cacheSolve) either calculates the inverse of the matrix object from makeCacheMatrix or, if 
## the inverse has already been calculated and the matrix hasnt changed, it retrieves the result from the cache.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
